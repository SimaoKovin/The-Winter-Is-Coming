The winter is coming!

The application I made is an analog clock thematically decorated with Game of Thrones' House Stark in mind.

The application possesses the following characteristics:

Showing time 

Settable alarm clock with a snooze, stop and cancel options

To-do list with options of adding tasks, crossing tasks over by clicking on them, removing individual items via doubleclick and clearing the entire list bia 'clear list' button.

During the development of the application I've used Html, CSS, Javascript, and Adobe Illustrator.

The application has one of each: HTML, CSS and Javascript files.

Additionally the application uses picture files for clock face, each of the handles and an .p3 file for the alarm sound.
